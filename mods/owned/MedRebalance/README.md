# Med Rebalance

**Ребаланс медицини** · **SPT 4.0.13** · **v1.3.0** · Server + Client

Medicine rebalance: faster surgery/splints, continuous multi-limb healing, scratch top-ups from medkit resource, and interrupt-on-damage.

Developed and tested against **SPT 4.0.13**.

Formerly *Fast Surgery* — remove old `SPT/user/mods/FastSurgery/` and `BepInEx/plugins/FastSurgery.Client.dll` / Continuous Healing before installing.

[Latest release](https://github.com/gadjed/MedRebalance-SPT-mod/releases/latest) · [License: MIT](LICENSE)

## Features

- **Server:** configurable `MedUseTime` for splints and surgical kits (default **5s**)
- **Client — continuous healing:** after one limb finishes, healing continues to the next (bleed / fracture treatment still uses vanilla `DoMedEffect`)
- **Client — scratch heal:** while continuing, other limbs missing only a few HP get **2–3 HP** topped up from the **medkit resource**; empty kit ends healing
- **Client — cancel on damage:** any HP damage during healing cancels the med use, fast-forwards the put-away, and restores the last weapon
- Incompatible with standalone Continuous Healing (`com.lacyway.ch`) — remove that plugin
